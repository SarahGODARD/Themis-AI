# Install pytorch

## Prerequise

First, make sure you have download [python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/). I recommand you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) to handle your environement. Use the corresponding documentation in the documentation folder. You will can find a yml cuda environment for pytorch in the environment folder.

The version of pytorch installed her fit the 10 version of CUDA.
